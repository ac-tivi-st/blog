Domain is ac.tivi.st. I think so good that is good name for a calendar/event application project. I&amp;rsquo;ll use AWS platform for cloud requirement. Besides, each service&amp;rsquo;s project structure will be clean architecture style.
As the first step, I want to create a simple working version.
I&amp;rsquo;ve bought domain (tivi.st) I&amp;rsquo;ve created an AWS account. I&amp;rsquo;ve created a terraform.io account for terraform state.</description></item></channel></rss>
