The `ac.tivi.st` is a calendar web application project. This project is started as a side/pet project. The goal apply modern technologies on that project. And I want to share my experience from here.

The main technologies in that project;
- Golang (mainly), Rust (maybe), Kotlin (maybe) (for micro-services)
- Github Actions for Deployment
- React (frontend)
- AWS (amazon web services)
- Terraform
- Kubernetes
- Istio
- etc...

Besides I want to improve my English with that blog. If you have any feedback about my entries, please do not hesitate to open a pull-request or create a task from https://github.com/ac-tivi-st/blog url.

Btw, I could not decide to do open source this project yet. I will update you next days on that blog if I change my idea.
